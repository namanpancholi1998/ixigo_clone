# Ixigo Clone Project

## Overview

This project is an Ixigo clone, designed to provide users with seamless navigation and booking functionalities for various travel services, including flights, trains, buses, and hotels. The focus is on creating an intuitive user interface that enhances the user experience.

## Features

### Feature 1: Navigation Bar

- **Accessibility**: The navigation bar is accessible from any page on the Ixigo website, allowing users to quickly switch between services.
- **Hover Effect**: Each option in the navbar changes color when hovered over, indicating that it's clickable. The "Flights" option is selected by default and is displayed as the Home/Landing Page.

#### Layout:

- **Logo**: The Ixigo logo is located at the top left. Clicking it redirects users to the homepage.
- **Service Options**: The navbar includes buttons for:
  - **Flights** (default selected)
  - **Trains**
  - **Buses**
  - **Hotels**
- **Redirection**: Each service button navigates to the respective booking or information page:
  - **Flights**: Redirects to the flight booking page.
  - **Trains**: Navigates to the train ticket booking section.
  - **Buses**: Redirects to the bus ticket booking page.
  - **Hotels**: Opens the hotel search and booking interface.
- **User Icon**: On the right side, there’s a user icon that displays either the user’s name or greets with "Hi Traveller." If the user is not logged in, it shows "Login/SignUp," linking to the login page.

### Feature 2: Home Page (Flights Page)

- This section serves as the main entry point of the application.

#### Main Search Panel

- A prominent search panel allows users to search for flights easily.

#### Additional Features

- **Advertisement Banner**: A static promotional banner (e.g., "Flat 12% off on Domestic Flights") is included, which is not clickable.
- **Best Flight Booking Offers**:
  - Below the search panel, a section displays the best flight booking offers.
  - **API Integration**:
  - Each offer card includes a title and a description.
  - **Navigation Arrows**: Left and right arrows are included to scroll through the offers.

## Conclusion
